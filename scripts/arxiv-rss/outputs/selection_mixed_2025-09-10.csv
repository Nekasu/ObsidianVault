Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses (or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network generators: Erd\""{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC, which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs, offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance comparable to ORC.",./filter.py

Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning. Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex preparations, and the lack of comprehensive labeled datasets that cover its full breadth. Through this exploration, we uncover Khana, a new benchmark dataset for food image classification, segmentation, and retrieval of dishes from Indian cuisine. Khana fills the gap by establishing a taxonomy of Indian cuisine and offering around 131K images in the dataset spread across 80 labels, each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification, segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for researchers while also serving as a valuable resource for developers creating real-world applications that leverage the rich tapestry of Indian cuisine.

Abstract: Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.",./filter.py

Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains. To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.",./filter.py

Abstract: This paper presents IMAGGarment, a fine-grained garment generation (FGG) framework that enables high-fidelity garment synthesis with precise control over silhouette, color, and logo placement. Unlike existing methods that are limited to single-condition inputs, IMAGGarment addresses the challenges of multi-conditional controllability in personalized fashion design and digital apparel applications. Specifically, IMAGGarment employs a two-stage training strategy to separately model global appearance and local details, while enabling unified and controllable generation through end-to-end inference. In the first stage, we propose a global appearance model that jointly encodes silhouette and color using a mixed attention module and a color adapter. In the second stage, we present a local enhancement model with an adaptive appearance-aware module to inject user-defined logos and spatial constraints, enabling accurate placement and visual consistency. To support this task, we release GarmentBench, a large-scale dataset comprising over 180K garment samples paired with multi-level design conditions, including sketches, color references, logo placements, and textual prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior structural stability, color fidelity, and local controllability performance.

Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls, the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states: stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state, offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced assistance systems.",./filter.py

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV imagery. To address this limitation, we first propose a refined UAV-Label engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000 instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images). Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE) module and integrate it into the YOLO-World-v2 architecture. Finally, extensive experiments on the VisDrone and SIMD datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed method for applications in UAV-based imagery and remote sensing.",./filter.py
