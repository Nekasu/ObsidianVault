Abstract: Motion estimation is a crucial component in multi-object tracking (MOT). It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and identity switches. The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of the most commonly used methods in MOT. However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are mismatched and objects move in non-stationary. In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion estimation of MOT. In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet (SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps. First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state vectors to encode independent semantic information. Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between heterogeneous-semantic elements. To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several open-source MOT datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing learning-aided filters.

Abstract: The advancement of Embodied AI heavily relies on large-scale, simulatable 3D scene datasets characterized by scene diversity and realistic layouts. However, existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity, sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.",./filter.py --mode=mixed --seed=42

Abstract: The field of 4D world modeling - aiming to jointly capture spatial geometry and temporal dynamics - has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, driven by advances in large-scale generative models and multimodal learning. However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain, multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets, OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the physical world.",./filter.py --mode=mixed --seed=42

Abstract: Fetal motion is a critical indicator of neurological development and intrauterine health, yet its quantification remains challenging, particularly at earlier gestational ages (GA). Current methods track fetal motion by predicting the location of annotated landmarks on 3D echo planar imaging (EPI) time-series, primarily in third-trimester fetuses. The predicted landmarks enable simplification of the fetal body for downstream analysis. While these methods perform well within their training age distribution, they consistently fail to generalize to early GAs due to significant anatomical changes in both mother and fetus across gestation, as well as the difficulty of obtaining annotated early GA EPI data. In this work, we develop a cross-population data augmentation framework that enables pose estimation models to robustly generalize to younger GA clinical cohorts using only annotated images from older GA cohorts. Specifically, we introduce a fetal-specific augmentation strategy that simulates the distinct intrauterine environment and fetal positioning of early GAs. Our experiments find that cross-population augmentation yields reduced variability and significant improvements across both older GA and challenging early GA cases. By enabling more reliable pose estimation across gestation, our work potentially facilitates early clinical detection and intervention in challenging 4D fetal imaging settings.

Abstract: Generating high-quality 360{\deg} panoramic videos remains a significant challenge due to the fundamental differences between panoramic and traditional perspective-view projections. While perspective videos rely on a single viewpoint with a limited field of view, panoramic content requires rendering the full surrounding environment, making it difficult for standard video generation models to adapt. Existing solutions often introduce complex architectures or large-scale training, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal results. Motivated by the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in style transfer tasks, we propose treating panoramic video generation as an adaptation problem from perspective views. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that LoRA can effectively model the transformation between these projections when its rank exceeds the degrees of freedom in the task. Our approach efficiently fine-tunes a pretrained video diffusion model using only approximately 1,000 videos while achieving high-quality panoramic generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains proper projection geometry and surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality, left-right consistency, and motion diversity.",./filter.py --mode=mixed --seed=42

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation but pose increasing risks in terms of privacy, fairness, and security. A growing demand exists to \emph{erase} sensitive or harmful concepts (e.g., NSFW content, private individuals, artistic styles) from these models while preserving their overall generative capabilities. We introduce \textbf{SCORE} (Secure and Concept-Oriented Robust Erasure), a novel framework for robust concept removal in diffusion models. SCORE formulates concept erasure as an \emph{adversarial independence} problem, theoretically guaranteeing that the model's outputs become statistically independent of the erased concept. Unlike prior heuristic methods, SCORE minimizes the mutual information between a target concept and generated outputs, yielding provable erasure guarantees. We provide formal proofs establishing convergence properties and derive upper bounds on residual concept leakage. Empirically, we evaluate SCORE on Stable Diffusion and FLUX across four challenging benchmarks: object erasure, NSFW removal, celebrity face suppression, and artistic style unlearning. SCORE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods including EraseAnything, ANT, MACE, ESD, and UCE, achieving up to \textbf{12.5\%} higher erasure efficacy while maintaining comparable or superior image quality. By integrating adversarial optimization, trajectory consistency, and saliency-driven fine-tuning, SCORE sets a new standard for secure and robust concept erasure in diffusion models.",./filter.py --mode=mixed --seed=42

Abstract: Diminished reality (DR) refers to the digital removal of real-world objects by compositing background content in their place. This thesis presents a real-time, inpainting-based DR system designed to enable privacy control in shared-space mixed reality (MR) meetings. The system allows a primary headset user to selectively remove personal or sensitive items from their environment, ensuring that those objects are no longer visible to other participants. Removal is achieved through semantic segmentation and precise object selection, followed by real-time inpainting from the viewpoint of a secondary observer, implemented using a mobile ZED 2i depth camera. The solution is designed to be portable and robust, requiring neither a fixed secondary viewpoint nor prior 3D scanning of the environment. The system utilises YOLOv11 for object detection and a modified Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) model for high-quality video inpainting. At 720p resolution, the pipeline sustains frame rates exceeding 20 fps, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time diminished reality for practical privacy-preserving MR applications.",./filter.py --mode=mixed --seed=42
