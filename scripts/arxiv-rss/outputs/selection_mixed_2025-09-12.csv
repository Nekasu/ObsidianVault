Abstract: We introduce Reangle-A-Video, a unified framework for generating synchronized multi-view videos from a single input video. Unlike mainstream approaches that train multi-view video diffusion models on large-scale 4D datasets, our method reframes the multi-view video generation task as video-to-videos translation, leveraging publicly available image and video diffusion priors. In essence, Reangle-A-Video operates in two stages. (1) Multi-View Motion Learning: An image-to-video diffusion transformer is synchronously fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to distill view-invariant motion from a set of warped videos. (2) Multi-View Consistent Image-to-Images Translation: The first frame of the input video is warped and inpainted into various camera perspectives under an inference-time cross-view consistency guidance using DUSt3R, generating multi-view consistent starting images. Extensive experiments on static view transport and dynamic camera control show that Reangle-A-Video surpasses existing methods, establishing a new solution for multi-view video generation. We will publicly release our code and data. Project page: https://hyeonho99.github.io/reangle-a-video/",./filter.py --mode=mixed --seed=42

Abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However, in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then, similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports. The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods.

Abstract: This work presents a new dataset for the Martian digital elevation model prediction task, ready for machine learning applications called MCTED. The dataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a dataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very diverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity of the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts and missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to solve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training and validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to avoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical image patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were originally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the dataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide statistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial distribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and more. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and compare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model, DepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction. We find that even a very small architecture trained on this dataset specifically, beats a zero-shot performance of a depth estimation foundation model like DepthAnythingV2. We make the dataset and code used for its generation completely open source in public repositories.",./filter.py --mode=mixed --seed=42

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships. This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models. Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new, high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this direction.",./filter.py --mode=mixed --seed=42

Abstract: Digital cameras consume ~0.1 microjoule per pixel to capture and encode video, resulting in a power usage of ~20W for a 4K sensor operating at 30 fps. Imagining gigapixel cameras operating at 100-1000 fps, the current processing model is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement has been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the optical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling strategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is randomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated that images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by I2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial location, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the effectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS measurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to recover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and CCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we propose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention, global Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity of the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data show that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its higher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the application perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.",./filter.py --mode=mixed --seed=42

Abstract: Prompt-driven image analysis converts a single natural-language instruction into multiple steps: locate, segment, edit, and describe. We present a practical case study of a unified pipeline that combines open-vocabulary detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and vision-language description into a single workflow. The system works end to end from a single prompt, retains intermediate artifacts for transparent debugging (such as detections, masks, overlays, edited images, and before and after composites), and provides the same functionality through an interactive UI and a scriptable CLI for consistent, repeatable runs. We highlight integration choices that reduce brittleness, including threshold adjustments, mask inspection with light morphology, and resource-aware defaults. In a small, single-word prompt segment, detection and segmentation produced usable masks in over 90% of cases with an accuracy above 85% based on our criteria. On a high-end GPU, inpainting makes up 60 to 75% of total runtime under typical guidance and sampling settings, which highlights the need for careful tuning. The study offers implementation-guided advice on thresholds, mask tightness, and diffusion parameters, and details version pinning, artifact logging, and seed control to support replay. Our contribution is a transparent, reliable pattern for assembling modern vision and multimodal models behind a single prompt, with clear guardrails and operational practices that improve reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal.",./filter.py --mode=mixed --seed=42

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR, directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance, we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our pipeline will be made available at repository:https://github.com/xiepeijinhit-hue/textlessrag",./filter.py --mode=mixed --seed=42
