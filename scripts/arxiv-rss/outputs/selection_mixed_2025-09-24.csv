Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in novel view synthesis under dense-view settings. However, in sparse-view scenarios, despite the realistic renderings in training views, 3DGS occasionally manifests appearance artifacts in novel views. This paper investigates the appearance artifacts in sparse-view 3DGS and uncovers a core limitation of current approaches: the optimized Gaussians are overly-entangled with one another to aggressively fit the training views, which leads to a neglect of the real appearance distribution of the underlying scene and results in appearance artifacts in novel views. The analysis is based on a proposed metric, termed Co-Adaptation Score (CA), which quantifies the entanglement among Gaussians, i.e., co-adaptation, by computing the pixel-wise variance across multiple renderings of the same viewpoint, with different random subsets of Gaussians. The analysis reveals that the degree of co-adaptation is naturally alleviated as the number of training views increases. Based on the analysis, we propose two lightweight strategies to explicitly mitigate the co-adaptation in sparse-view 3DGS: (1) random gaussian dropout; (2) multiplicative noise injection to the opacity. Both strategies are designed to be plug-and-play, and their effectiveness is validated across various methods and benchmarks. We hope that our insights into the co-adaptation effect will inspire the community to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of sparse-view 3DGS.",./filter.py --mode=mixed --seed=42

Abstract: Automated pain assessment from facial expressions is crucial for non-communicative patients, such as those with dementia. Progress has been limited by two challenges: (i) existing datasets exhibit severe demographic and label imbalance due to ethical constraints, and (ii) current generative models cannot precisely control facial action units (AUs), facial structure, or clinically validated pain levels. We present 3DPain, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for automated pain assessment, featuring unprecedented annotation richness and demographic diversity. Our three-stage framework generates diverse 3D meshes, textures them with diffusion models, and applies AU-driven face rigging to synthesize multi-view faces with paired neutral and pain images, AU configurations, PSPI scores, and the first dataset-level annotations of pain-region heatmaps. The dataset comprises 82,500 samples across 25,000 pain expression heatmaps and 2,500 synthetic identities balanced by age, gender, and ethnicity. We further introduce ViTPain, a Vision Transformer based cross-modal distillation framework in which a heatmap-trained teacher guides a student trained on RGB images, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and clinical reliability. Together, 3DPain and ViTPain establish a controllable, diverse, and clinically grounded foundation for generalizable automated pain assessment.",./filter.py --mode=mixed --seed=42

Abstract: Gait is a key indicator in diagnosing movement disorders, but most models lack interpretability and rely on single datasets. We propose a dual-branch CNN-LSTM framework a 1D branch on joint-based features from GAVD and a 3D branch on silhouettes from OU-MVLP. Interpretability is provided by SHAP (temporal attributions) and Grad-CAM (spatial localization).On held-out sets, the system achieves 98.6% accuracy with strong recall and F1. This approach advances explainable gait analysis across both clinical and biometric domains.",./filter.py --mode=mixed --seed=42

Abstract: The reliable identification of mitotic figures in whole-slide histopathological images remains difficult, owing to their low prevalence, substantial morphological heterogeneity, and the inconsistencies introduced by tissue processing and staining procedures. The MIDOG competition series provides standardized benchmarks for evaluating detection approaches across diverse domains, thus motivating the development of generalizable deep learning models. In this work, we investigate the performance of two modern one-stage detectors, YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, trained on MIDOG++, CMC, and CCMCT datasets. To enhance robustness, training incorporated stain-invariant color perturbations and texture-preserving augmentations. Ininternal validation, YOLOv5 achieved higher precision (84.3%), while YOLOv8 offered improved recall (82.6%), reflecting architectural trade-offs between anchor-based and anchor-free detections. To capitalize on their complementary strengths, weemployed an ensemble of the two models, which improved sensitivity (85.3%) while maintaining competitive precision, yielding the best F1 score of 83.1%. On the preliminary MIDOG 2025 test leaderboard, our ensemble ranked 5th with an F1 score of 79.2%, precision of 73.6%, and recall of 85.8%, confirming that the proposed strategy generalizes effectively across unseen test data. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining anchor-based and anchor-free object detectors to advance automated mitosis detection in digital pathology.",./filter.py --mode=mixed --seed=42

Abstract: Few-shot font generation aims to create new fonts with a limited number of glyph references. It can be used to significantly reduce the labor cost of manual font design. However, due to the variety and complexity of font styles, the results generated by existing methods often suffer from visible defects, such as stroke errors, artifacts and blurriness. To address these issues, we propose DA-Font, a novel framework which integrates a Dual-Attention Hybrid Module (DAHM). Specifically, we introduce two synergistic attention blocks: the component attention block that leverages component information from content images to guide the style transfer process, and the relation attention block that further refines spatial relationships through interacting the content feature with both original and stylized component-wise representations. These two blocks collaborate to preserve accurate character shapes and stylistic textures. Moreover, we also design a corner consistency loss and an elastic mesh feature loss to better improve geometric alignment. Extensive experiments show that our DA-Font outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across diverse font styles and characters, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing structural integrity and local fidelity.

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to estimate accurate and robust 3D semantic correspondence with the hierarchical neural semantic representation. Our work has three key contributions. First, we design the hierarchical neural semantic representation (HNSR), which consists of a global semantic feature to capture high-level structure and multi-resolution local geometric features to preserve fine details, by carefully harnessing 3D priors from pre-trained 3D generative models. Second, we design a progressive global-to-local matching strategy, which establishes coarse semantic correspondence using the global semantic feature, then iteratively refines it with local geometric features, yielding accurate and semantically-consistent mappings. Third, our framework is training-free and broadly compatible with various pre-trained 3D generative backbones, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse shape categories. Our method also supports various applications, such as shape co-segmentation, keypoint matching, and texture transfer, and generalizes well to structurally diverse shapes, with promising results even in cross-category scenarios. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques.",./filter.py --mode=mixed --seed=42

Abstract: The completion, extension, and generation of 3D semantic scenes are an interrelated set of capabilities that are useful for robotic navigation and exploration. Existing approaches seek to decouple these problems and solve them oneoff. Additionally, these approaches are often domain-specific, requiring separate models for different data distributions, e.g. indoor vs. outdoor scenes. To unify these techniques and provide cross-domain compatibility, we develop a single framework that can perform scene completion, extension, and generation in both indoor and outdoor scenes, which we term Octree Latent Semantic Diffusion. Our approach operates directly on an efficient dual octree graph latent representation: a hierarchical, sparse, and memory-efficient occupancy structure. This technique disentangles synthesis into two stages: (i) structure diffusion, which predicts binary split signals to construct a coarse occupancy octree, and (ii) latent semantic diffusion, which generates semantic embeddings decoded by a graph VAE into voxellevel semantic labels. To perform semantic scene completion or extension, our model leverages inference-time latent inpainting, or outpainting respectively. These inference-time methods use partial LiDAR scans or maps to condition generation, without the need for retraining or finetuning. We demonstrate highquality structure, coherent semantics, and robust completion from single LiDAR scans, as well as zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution LiDAR data. These results indicate that completion-through-generation in a dual octree graph latent space is a practical and scalable alternative to regression-based pipelines for real-world robotic perception tasks.",./filter.py --mode=mixed --seed=42
