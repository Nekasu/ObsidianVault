# Team work

  1. Important
    1. Articulate ideas and actively listen to others' viewpoints is the beginning of all. In my work experience, while I organize my laboratory mates for a seminar, I usually urge them to keep communicating. This will avoid different people do the same thing. While someone complete a preparing job, the other can immediately continue to do the rest ones.
  2. Success and fail
    1. In approaching success and failure in team collaboration, I adopt the principle of '居安思危' (being prepared for adversity in times of peace). This means that while celebrating successes is important, it is equally crucial to remain vigilant and prepared for potential challenges or setbacks. Successes provide valuable insights into what works well within the team, while failures offer opportunities for growth and improvement.
    2. No matter what kind of result we've gotten or we'll get, learning something from the experience is the most important thing.
